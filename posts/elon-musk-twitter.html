      <p>For those that don't know yet, Elon Musk just bought Twitter for around $44 Billion USD. Why you may ask?A lot of people are still extremely confused on why he even bought the social media company. Personally, I think it's getting too much attention for what it is.</p>
      <p>This recent purchase has made global news, on all media outlets. What even is twitter? It's just a place where people can inform people about things, right? Should it really get so much attention from the media? </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color: #ffaa00;;">Elon and Free speech</h2>
<p>He claims he mainly bought twitter in intention to improve free speech on the platform. “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.” Elon said in a tweet. When closing the deal with the previous owner of Twitter, he made sure that they agreed that he could make the company private. </p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">🚀💫♥️ Yesss!!! ♥️💫🚀 <a href="https://t.co/0T9HzUHuh6">pic.twitter.com/0T9HzUHuh6</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1518677066325053441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

    <p> He claims that he will make algorithms public...? I wonder what Twitter was hiding from us before? Were they even hiding anything by keeping their code private, or was it just to make it so people can't steal their algorithms? Who knows...</p>
        <p>Anyways, I myself am pretty interested to see what happens with Twitter in the future. Will he actually make it a better platform, or is he just saying that so the twitter community is happy?</p>
