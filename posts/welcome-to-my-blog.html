      <h2 style="color: #3a88fe; black;padding-top: .7rem;">About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm 16 years old at the time of writing this. I started to gain interest in programming in 2021. I started to code <a style="color: blue;">discord</a> bots and I realized how fun programming was. In Febuary of 2021, I decided to create an orginization called Launchpad Development. Here, my partner and I, sold our services. We created things such as Discord bots, websites, and minecraft servers, and sold them. This orginization really boosted my interest to learn more about technology & programming. After making numerous websites, Discord bots, and more, we decided to shutdown the orginization. <br></br>Fast-forward to now -- I'm currently working on an orginization called <a href="https://techoptimum.org"style="color: orange;">Tech Optimum.</a> Tech Optimum is an non-profit orginization in which teens can join to become better at programming. This orginization focuses on empowering teens to give them the proper resources to become a better coder. We will offer features such as, hackathons, weekly zoom meetings, tech workshops, guest speakers, and more. This orginization is completely virtual and free to join. It is planned to release in April of 2022.  </p>
