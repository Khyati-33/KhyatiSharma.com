      Discord is a popular chat app that is used by many people. It is used by
      gamers, streamers, and many other people. It is a great app, but is it
      dying?
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      COVID-19 made lots of people, including myself, switch to online chat
      places. I first started using Discord in 2018, however, I became a daily
      user when COVID struck in 2020. I used to own a Discord server with 3k
      members, which I deleted in 2021 as I couldn't manage it anymore due to
      time constraints. A lot of my online friends from Discord have gone
      inactive/have deleted their accounts. I still use Discord, but I
      definitely don't use it as much as I once did.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Well, why are less people using Discord? People are now interacting more
      IRL rather than online. The large majority of Discord users are under 18,
      and in high school. When Covid was a thing, people were stuck at home, and
      had nothing to do. They would spend their time on Discord. Now that people
      are back in school, they have less time to spend on Discord.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Tbh, the future of Discord doesn't seem too bright. They have made less
      revenue in 2022 than how much they made in the preceding years, 2021 and
      2020. They will definitely still be profitable, but it won't be used as
      much as people used it in 2020. Recently, they've began adding more
      features to their app, and I think that it will help them. They have also
      been adding new "perks" for "discord nitro" users. For example, they've
      added a new banner feature for people to use. They've also allowed
      background gradients for profiles, as shown below.

    <h2>So, what's next?</h2>

    <p>
      I'm not sure what Discord has planned next, but I do know that more people
      are buying nitro right now because of their holiday discounts happening. I
      do hope Discord grows more, but I'm just not sure how they will make their
      platform thrive...
