      <p>Hi, the topic I chose was Big Data. The resources I used: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMrDHtGHFR4" style="color: green;">"Data and Medicine"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XGo8K1boH4" style="color: green;">"How Parallel Processing Works"</a></p>

      <h2 style="color: #ffaa00;;">How Parallel Processing Works</h2>
      <p>Parallel processing is the process in which you take a large amount of things and process them all at the same time. In the video, they talked about using GPU parallel processors. They used this to work through a lot of data really quickly, as it's the most effective & efficient. GPA's have thousands of processor cores which makes it much faster to process data. This type of processing is used in many different fields of technology. AI (Artificial Intellegence) is furthur being advanced through parallel processing. In the future, we will see self driving cars to become more common. This is because through parallel processing, it can make AI faster which makes it more efficient, which means that more people will use it in the future. </p>

        <h2 style="color: #ffaa00;;">Data and Medicine</h2>
<p>The second video, data and medicine, talked about the following. Our DNA sequences are over 3 billion letters long.</p>
